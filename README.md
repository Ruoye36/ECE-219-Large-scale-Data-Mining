Project 5 required me to define a new problem. I chose to investigate factors that affect Twitter sentiment during the Super Bowl. I found out that highly influential (as measured by number of impressions among other metrics) can sway the general Twitter sentiment level. I built a model to predict the general sentiment level using several Twitter metrics as features.
